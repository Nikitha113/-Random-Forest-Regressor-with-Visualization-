# -Random-Forest-Regressor-with-Visualization-
 📌 Project Overview This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a **Random Forest Regressor** using Python.   A custom dataset is created using a dictionary, the model is trained, predictions are made, and results are visualized using **Matplotlib**.   Additionally, one decision tree from the random forest is visualized to understand
## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset
A simple user-defined dataset is created using a Python dictionary:

- **Input Feature:** Hours Studied  
- **Target Variable:** Marks Obtained  

This avoids external file uploads and keeps the project beginner-friendly.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Created dataset using Python dictionary  
2. Converted data into Pandas DataFrame  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Trained Random Forest Regressor model  
5. Predicted output values  
6. Evaluated model using Mean Squared Error  
7. Visualized Actual vs Predicted values using Matplotlib  
8. Visualized a Decision Tree from the Random Forest  

## 🌳 Model Used
**Random Forest Regressor**
- Ensemble learning method
- Uses multiple decision trees
- Final prediction is the average of all tree predictions

## 📈 Visualizations
- Scatter plot comparing Actual vs Predicted values  
- Decision Tree visualization using `plot_tree()`
  
## 🧪 Evaluation Metric
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Run cells in sequence  
3. Observe predictions and visualizations  

## 📌 Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding ensemble learning
- Working with Random Forest Regression
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Interpreting decision tree structure
